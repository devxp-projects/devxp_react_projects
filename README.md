# Repository for DevXP projects
This repository is the monorepo for all DevXP projects for the year. Please fork it and head to your Cohorts project to work there.

## Project structure
Each app is divided into two. The main app and the test app. The main app has the app name eg food-hut and the test app has e2e at the end of its name e.g food-hut-e2e. Just work on the app that your cohort is working on and forget about the rest.

## How to run an App
We use ```yarn``` as our package manager. So under no circumstance should ```npm``` be used.

Each app is run by running yarn plus the name of your cohort, - the environment. So to run Ch3 web (React(NextJS)) just run 
```bash
    yarn ch3-web
    or
    yarn ch3-api 
```
The API is for Nodejs.
